                        Printer calibration:
                        </h3>
                        Before printing on a new printer/ extruder, a few things have to be done to ensure that prints come out decently.
                    
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            Firstly, the bed needs to be leveled to ensure that the nozzle is able to place down a perfect first layer of plastic. Although some higher end printers may have an automatic bed leveling system like the BLtouch, both the school printer (makerbot replicator v2) and my printer (ender 3) do not come equipped with these.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            Secondly, the extruder needs to be calibrated to ensure that the correct amount of material is extruded through the nozzle. This can be one of the most important steps as most aspects of printing rely on the correct amount of plastic being extruded. As such, it can determine if your print looks like intended.
                        </li>
                            
                        </ul>

                            Layer height:
                            This determines how thick each layer is. The thicker the layer height, the faster the print is completed, however, it can leave unsightly artifacts on the surface of the print.
                        </p>

                            Infill percentage:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            This parameter determines how dense the inside (infill) of the model will be. The higher the infill, the stronger and heavier the print. On the other hand, a higher infill percentage will result in a longer print time and higher filament usage. Thus, a low percentage (15%) is usually used for most prints that don't need the added strength.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is worth noting that vase mode (spiralise contour) can reduce print time even more in situations where infill is not required. This mode is can also be used to calibrate line width for a printer.

                        <h3>Printing TPU: </h3>
                        <p>
                            What i learned from research and abit of experience is that TPU, at least on my setup, has to be printed slow (around 20mm/s), otherwise the flexible filament may come out of the extruder assembly and cause a print failure. It also has to be printed hotter than typical PLA and extrusion multiplier should be increased to around 145% to compensate for the underextrusion.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            This is because TPU is much more flexible than PLA and is prone to clogging. This issue is especially prevalent in bowden style printers, where the extruder motor is far away from the hotend, meaning that it is more likely that the filament can jam up inside the tube or extruder assembly if either the printing speed is too high, or retraction is enabled.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            During experimention with this material, i found out that TPU tends to have poor horizontal layer adhesion if the temperature is not tuned correctly. However if printing temperature is too high, stringing will become a huge issue since TPU strings are much harder to clean up than PLA strings, which snap off when pulled
                        </p>
